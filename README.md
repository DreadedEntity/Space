# Space

This is a simple project I made to re-familiarize myself with drawing on-screen using Java AWT.
This program simulates a typical space scene with stars moving across from right to left.
Stars have a randomly-generated y value, size, speed, and color/brightness.
Possible star colors are white(70%), yellow(10%), red(10%), blue(10%).
